# Problem statement

In high-throughput studies, it's common to have one or more 
phenotypes or groupings that we want to relate to features of 
interest (eg, gene expression, DNA methylation levels).
In general, we want to identify differences in the 
features of interest
that are related to a phenotype or grouping of our samples.
Identifying features of interest that vary along with
phenotypes or groupings can allow us to understand how
phenotypes arise or manifest.

For example, we might want to identify genes that are
expressed at a higher level in mutant mice relative
to wild-type mice to understand the effect
of a mutation on cellular phenotypes.
Alternatively, we might have
samples from a set of patients, and wish to identify
epigenetic features that are different in young patients
relative to old patients, to help us understand how aging
manifests.

Using linear regression, it's possible to identify differences
like these . However, high-dimensional data like the ones we're
working with require some special considerations.

Ideally, we want to identify cases like this, where there is a
clear difference, and we probably "don't need" statistics:
