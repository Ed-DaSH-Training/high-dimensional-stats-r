In the previous episode we covered variable selection using stepwise/best subset
selection.
These have issues with respect to computation time and efficiency.

In low noise settings and with few or strong relationships, stepwise/subset
works well. However that's often not what we're faced with in biomedicine.


# Ridge regression

When we fit a linear model, we're minimising the RSS.

$$
    \sum_{i=1}^N y_i - X\beta
$$

The idea of regularisation is to add another condition to this to control
the size of the coefficients that come out.

One idea is to control the squared sum of the coefficients, $\beta$.
This is also sometimes called the $L^2$ norm. This is defined as

$$
    |\beta|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2}
$$

To control this, we specify that the solution for the equation above
also has to have an $L^2$ norm smaller than a certain amount. Or, equivalently,
we try to minimise a function that includes our $L^2$ norm scaled by a 
factor that is usually written $\lambda$.

$$
    \sum_{i=1}^N y_i - X\beta + \lambda|\beta|_2
$$

Now we can fit a model using ridge regression.

library("glmnet")
ridge <- glmnet(methyl_mat, age, alpha = 0)

# LASSO regression

LASSO is another type of regularisation. In this case we use the $L^1$ norm,
or the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.

$$
    |\beta|_1 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j}
$$

This tends to produce
